# Sitemap
Rename `public/sitemap.example.xml` to `public/sitemap.xml` and update the contents using the protocol described [here](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).

If a sitemap is not required for the project it can be deleted to prevent `sitemap.example.xml` being added to the build folder.

## Robots.txt
Uncomment and update the sitemap url in `public/robots.txt` to allow the robots to find the sitemap.
