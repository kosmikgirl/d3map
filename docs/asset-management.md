# Asset Management
There are 3 different types of assets that this scaffold supports.

## Public

The public assets live in `./public` and these assets will be put in the root of the build folder once the app is built.

Assets like `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` should be put here.

## Static

These assets live in `./static` and are files that are not imported inside the app. 

Assets like `favicon.svg` should be put here.


## Asset

These assets live in `./src/asset` and are files that are imported somewhere in the app.

Assets like `fonts`, `images`, `svgs` should be put here.
